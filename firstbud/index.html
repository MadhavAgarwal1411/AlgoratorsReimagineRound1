                            Raw comb honey is a pure and unprocessed form of
                            honey that includes the edible beeswax comb. It's
                            harvested directly from the hive, showcasing the
                            natural hexagonal cells created by bees to store
                            honey. This type of honey is prized for its delicate
                            flavor and texture, often enjoyed as a gourmet
                            treat. It retains all the natural enzymes, pollen,
                            and antioxidants found in honey, making it a
                            sought-after choice for those who appreciate its
                            unaltered sweetness and health benefits.
